      <h2>Dragonfruit</h2>
      <p>
        Dragon fruit, otherwise known as Pitaya, has a vibrant pink, thick outer skin with spikey-looking green growths.
        Dragon fruit is usually pink on the outside with a white or vibrant pink flesh and dotted with small black edible seeds throughout. 
        Dragon fruit can sometimes have yellow skin as well, and this variety only has a white flesh with small black edible seeds.

      <h2>Mangosteen</h2>
      <p>
        Mangosteen is a type of tropical fruit that has a purple outer shell with beautiful translucent-white fruit on the inside.
        The fruit is naturally sectioned off into segments, and you can tell how many segments will be in the mangosteen by looking at the bottom of the mangosteen at the flat, flower-shaped growth and counting the “petals” that the flower shape has.
        When opened, the smaller segments tend to have no seeds, while the bigger segments usually have an inedible seed.
