      <p>
        A recurve bow is the bow of choice for both recreational archers and Olympic archers. 
        This type of bow consists of a riser (handle) and a pair of limbs in varying weight, which can be disassembled for easier customization, transportation, and storage. 
        These bows can be attached with other shooting accessories, including but not limited to: arrow rests, sights, and stabilizers.

      <h2>Barebow & Traditional Archery</h2>
      <p>These terms are interchangeable but can refer to two distinct shooting styles:</p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.worldarchery.sport/sport/equipment/barebow" _blank>Barebow</a></h3>
        <img src="https://www.usarchery.org/images/tinymce/130722203845-i-T5dfZWd-X3.jpg" alt="Barebow recurve" height="350">
        <p>
          Barebow archery typically means competitive shooting without sights, usually using a recurve bow with metal risers.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://archery360.com/2019/08/21/traditional-archery-101/" _blank>Traditional</a></h3>
        <img src="https://cole-huntingretailer.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntingretailer.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2F2020-Traditional-Bows.jpg?fit=clip&ixlib=php-1.1.0&q=85&w=1400&s=3e88baed267a83efc9e846fb96378488" alt="Traditional bows" height="350">
        <p>
          Traditional archery, however, covers a wider range of bows, and includes recurves, long bows, war bows, etc., which may be crafted using wood or modern metals and carbon fiber.
